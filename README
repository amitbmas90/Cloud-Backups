Cloud Backups is a little tool I'm writing to learn the Go programming
language. Currently, it only does backups from delicious.com, and saves into
local disk.  In the future, it will be possible to send the files to an
external storage provider (rsync.net, Google Docs).

Build instructions:
Use gobuild[1] to build the project tools.

$ cd src ; gobuild -a

How to use:
Just call the respective utility and it will try to save a backup for you. The
default storage directory is $HOME/cloudbackups.

Examples:
$ delicious -user=<user> -password=<password>

For more options, run:
$ delicious -h

Good luck!
